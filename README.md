# Introduction-to-Python-Nanodegree

I am not much of a  Writer 

## This repo contains 1 project which i did during my [Udacity-Python-Foundation-Nanodegree](https://in.udacity.com/course/python-foundation-nanodegree--nd002-inpy)

We had to work on jupyter notebook and Explore Bike-share Data  and answer  some of the questions. It was a Fun experience Working as a Data-Scientist.
